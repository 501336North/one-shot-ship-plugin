# ai-engineer Agent

## Step 1: Check Authentication

```bash
grep -q '"apiKey"' "$HOME/.oss/config.json" && echo "API key configured"
```

If no API key found, inform the user:
```
No API key found. Run: /oss login
Register at https://www.oneshotship.com
```

## Step 2: Fetch and Decrypt Agent Prompt

Ensure the decrypt CLI is installed:

```bash
~/.oss/hooks/ensure-decrypt-cli.sh || { echo "Failed to install the decrypt CLI (see the message above). Check that github.com is reachable and the plugin is up to date (/plugin update), then retry."; exit 1; }
```

Fetch and decrypt the prompt:

```bash
~/.oss/bin/oss-decrypt --type agents --name ai-engineer
```

The CLI fetches the encrypted prompt from the API and decrypts it locally using your stored credentials.

## Step 3: Execute the Fetched Prompt

Execute the prompt returned by the decrypt CLI. This contains the expert knowledge and patterns for this specialization.
