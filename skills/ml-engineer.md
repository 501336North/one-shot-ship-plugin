# OSS Ml Engineer Agent

Expert ml engineer powered by One Shot Ship.

## Step 1: Check Authentication

```bash
~/.oss/hooks/oss-value.sh keycheck
```

If no API key found:
```
No API key found. Run: /oss login
Register at https://www.oneshotship.com
```

## Step 2: Fetch Agent Prompt from API

Install the decrypt CLI if it is missing (a fresh install has none yet):

```bash
~/.oss/hooks/ensure-decrypt-cli.sh || { echo "Failed to install the decrypt CLI (see the message above). Check that github.com is reachable and the plugin is up to date (/plugin update), then retry."; exit 1; }
```

```bash
~/.oss/bin/oss-decrypt --type agents --name ml-engineer
```

## Step 3: Execute the Fetched Prompt

The API returns the expert prompt which you execute directly.
